- before the fights start (maybe when the prelims start?) close voting
    - for each react, assign their picks into the database
- every 5min? poll the wikipedia page for if the fight has ended
- if the fight has ended, then assign winners and losers to the db
- generate an image using selenium? of whos left and whos heemed
- if theres a winner, let everyone know who won and put out the image
